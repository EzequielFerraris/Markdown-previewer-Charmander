## Here you can anticipate how markdown text will be seen...
### With a Charmander-like interface! :)
![Charmander, logo](https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/004.png)

You can create inline elements between 2 backticks: \`<div><p>Char, char, charmander</p></div>\`.

This is a hot line of code:

\`\`\`
function flamethrower(charmander) {
    charmander.attack.flamethrower();
    charmander.mp.flamethrower--;
};
\`\`\`

And of course there are lists:
- Attack.
- Item.
- Run.

You can also make text **strong like Charmander's claws**... 
Or _sharp_.
Or just combine **_growl!_**

1. Like this.
2. Use it as you want!
3. And last but not least:
